# ChatGpt Writer

This assignment involves creating a Chrome extension using React and TypeScript. When a message is clicked in LinkedIn's message input box, an AI icon appears. Clicking this icon opens a chat UI message prompt, allowing the user to communicate directly with ChatGPT. Users can input their message, and once a response is generated, it can be directly inserted into the message box.
